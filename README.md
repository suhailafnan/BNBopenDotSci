# OpenDotSci 🧪📡

**OpenDotSci** is a full-stack **decentralized science (DeSci)** platform built on **opBNB** and **BNB Greenfield**. It empowers researchers to **publish, review, fund, and track scientific work entirely on-chain**, enabling a truly open, transparent, and community-driven future for scientific collaboration.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔗 Decentralized Publishing  
- Research papers are minted as **ERC-721 NFTs** on opBNB.  
- All content — papers, datasets, reviews, and funding proposals — is **permanently stored on BNB Greenfield**, ensuring transparency and immutability.

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Peer Review  
- Submissions are screened by an **AI agent** for basic relevance and quality.  
- Verified submissions undergo **stake-to-review** voting by the community to ensure high-quality reviews and reduce spam.

### 🪪 Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)  
- Reviewers and replicators earn **non-transferable tokens** (SBTs) as proof of contribution.  
- SBTs build an on-chain **academic identity** that forms a verifiable, censorship-resistant scientific CV.

### 🧱 Modular DAO Launchpad  
- Labs, universities, or foundations can deploy **custom grant-giving subDAOs** instantly.  
- Proposal submissions, voting, and fund distribution are **fully on-chain and transparent**.

### 💸 Perpetual Royalties & Reputation  
- Authors earn **royalties on NFT transfers** of their papers.  
- Every review, citation, comment, and replication is tracked, enabling **impact traceability**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (opBNB, BSC Testnet)  
- **Storage**: BNB Greenfield via Greenfield SDK & Bridge  
- **Frontend**: React, Web3.js / Ethers.js  
- **AI Layer**: GPT-based NLP agent for initial screening  
- **Identity**: Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), zk-ID integration (planned)

## 🎯 Problem Addressed

Modern science is locked behind:
- Centralized, expensive, paywalled journals  
- Slow, opaque peer review systems  
- Inefficient and non-transparent funding pipelines  

**OpenDotSci** provides a decentralized alternative by:
- Making research **open-access**  
- Enabling **community-driven peer review and funding**  
- Giving researchers full control over their **data, identity, and impact**

---

## 🌱 Future Roadmap

- ✅ Integrate **ZK-proof-based reviewer identities**  
- ✅ Enable **dataset storage with citation tracing**  
- ✅ Partner with academic institutions for **pilot programs**  
- 🔜 Launch **cross-chain DeSci indexing protocols**  
- 🔜 Add **automated reproducibility detection** modules
